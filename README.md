## Emulator Project

This is a project aimed at creating old CPU emulators,
bus emulators, and any devices, such as keyboard and
monitor emulators.

### Backstory

Computers have always fascinated me.  I enjoys programming them,
learning how they work, and learning the history behind them.
I've been around them since the early '80s, when I was a kid,
and "home" computers at the time were mostly simple, 8 bit machines
that hooked up to a TV.  Most of them had under 64K (yes K) of
RAM, simple graphics, simple (if any) sound capabilities, and 
they ran at less than 5mHz. None had hard drives, and only a very 
few had floppy drives. We had to use cassette tapes for long term 
storage.  Those were the days.  Most had some form of built in 
BASIC.

### Directories

* **6502_cpu** MOS Technology 6502 CPU emulator
* **8080_cpu** Intell 8080 CPU emulator
* **dynosaur** Emulator tesing platform with a plugable CPU framework
* **include**  Sharable header files from all subdirectories.
* **markII**   Apple II emulator that uses the 6502 CPU emulation
* **shell**    Basic shell library to test and control emulators
